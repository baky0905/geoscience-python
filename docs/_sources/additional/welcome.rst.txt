Welcome to Geoscience with Python!
===================

All the `jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/baky0905/geoscience-python/tree/master/source/notebooks>`_ 
and data are located in `github repo <https://github.com/baky0905/geoscience-python/tree/master/source>`_ 
.

This is also the `root folder <https://github.com/baky0905/geoscience-python/tree/master/source>`_ 
for all relative paths in the notebooks.

**Purpose**

Create practical data analysis and data science online reproducible sphinx booklet for common Geoscience and Petroleum Engineering problems. Key is to enable people to solve their own problems.

.. **Purpose**
    The booklet provides the practical data science ana analysis for Geoscience and Petroleum Engineering community. The key goal is to provide the introductoray toturial for the community inorder to make a better descisions backed by data in their processes.



**What kind of code will we be using?**

* Personal automation
* Consistent ways of writing code
* Code that you are writing for yourself and you are the only person who is going to be using it

.. ** The codes provided in the booklet are designed for:

**What kind of code will we NOT be using?**

* Professional code
* Checked in code
* Reviewed code

.. ** are NOT designed for:
You can some cut corners, write some crappy code and do some things that questionable but all of it is just fine - no one will ever see it and no one will ever know.

**Main goal - solve your problem!**

**Motivate you to maybe dive in deeper and become semi-professional one day!**
